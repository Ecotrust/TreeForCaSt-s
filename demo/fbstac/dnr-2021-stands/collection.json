  "description": "RS-FRIS is a remote-sensing based forest inventory for WA DNR State Trust lands. RS-FRIS predicts forest  conditions using statistical models that relate field measurements to three-dimensional remotely-sensed data  (PhoDAR and LiDAR point clouds). Forest metrics are predicted at a scale of 1/10th acre and stored as rasters.  The attributes of each RIU are calculated as the mean of the raster cell values that fall within each polygon.  Note: origin year and age are exceptions, and are based on the median value.The attributes represent forest  conditions as of mid-2017. Origin year and age are periodically updated to reflect harvest activities; all  other attributes continue to report mid-2017 conditions.\n",
